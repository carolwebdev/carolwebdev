#I graduated in Law in 2012, but in 2020 I decided to change careers. Since then, i've taken several courses such as HTML5, CSS3, JS, .NET, C# and Python. Throughout these months, #I've taken on some challenges, that you can see in my repositories, but I'll admit they're not great, as I've got a long way to go. Nevertheless, I'm searching for my first #position as a junior or even an internship so that I can face the day-to-day problems and figure out how to solve them - that's what I like the most!
#Hope you have fun going through my repos :)
